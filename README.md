Simple time tracking application hosted on Google AppEngine.

This application fits my needs of a simple 1-button application to track my time spent in the office. It's just that: one button to start/stop tracking and a simple webpage displaying the overall sum of time that I spent in the office.

I'm working on a simple Android app as well, but the tracking will be useable via a regular browser from any device.
